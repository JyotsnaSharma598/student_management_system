## STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## OBJECTIVE
- The project can be used by any educational institute  to manage student information. This project provides an easy to use GUI for managing  and  providing student data. It improves the record management of an institute.
The main objective of this project is -
- To increase the  efficiency  of  college record management.
- To consume less time to  access  and  deliver  student  records. 
- To  reduce  paper  work. 

## TECHNOLOGY USED
- TKinter: Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.  It provides us with a variety of common GUI elements which we can use to build our interface – such as buttons, menus  and  various  kinds of entry fields and display areas. We call these elements  widgets. The widget classes provide us with a lot of default functionality. They have methods for  configuring  the GUI’s appearance – for example, arranging the elements according to some kind of  layout – and for handling various kinds of user-driven events.
- XAMPP  server: XAMPP  stands  for  Cross-Platform (X),  Apache (A),  MariaDB (M), PHP (P)  and Perl (P). It is a simple,  lightweight  Apache  distribution  that  makes  it  extremely easy  for  developers  to  create  a  local  web server for testing and deployment purposes. Everything needed to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MariaDB), and  scripting language (PHP) – is included in an extractable file. XAMPP  is  also  cross-platform, which means it works equally well on Linux, Mac and Windows. Since most actual web  server  deployments  use  the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server extremely easy as well.
- PYTHON: Python  is  a  high-level  programming  language  developed  by  Guido  van  Rossum  and  first  released in 1991. An interpreted  language,  Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code  readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax  that  allows  programmers  to  express  concepts in fewer  lines  of  code than might  be used  in  languages  such as  C++  or  Java. The language  provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both  small and large scale. 
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple  programming paradigms, including  object-oriented,  imperative,  functional  programming, and  procedural  styles. It  has  a  large and comprehensive  standard  library.
